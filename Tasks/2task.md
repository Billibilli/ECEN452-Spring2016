# Python Programming and PyCharm


## The Python Programming Language

[Python](https://www.python.org) is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability.
Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, allowing Python code execution on a wide variety of systems.

## Anaconda
I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for this class, especially if you are using Windows. Anaconda is a Python distribution for Mac, Windows, or Linux that includes all of the additional packages you will need for this class (matplolib, numpy, scipy, etc.). Install Anaconda on your computer and make note of the installation directory. Then when you need to select an interpreter for PyCharm, point to python.exe in the Anaconda folder.
