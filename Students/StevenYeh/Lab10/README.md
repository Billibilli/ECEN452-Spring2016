<b>ECEN 452-500: Ultra High Frequency Techniques</b><br>
Spring 2016 – Prof. Huff<br>
Lab 10


<br>Introduction:
This lab will demonstrate how to use the coaxial probe to measure the dielectric constant of different kinds of materials.<br>

Result:<b>
The original design parameters are shown in the following figures. Obviously, the results doesn't meet the requirement.<br>

<b>Conclusion:<br>

1. Dielectric constant of all the experimental material will change the values at different frequency. We observe the dielectric constant will decrease as the frequency goes higher.<br>
2. Dielectric loss ε" = σ/ω, for a lossless medium with σ =0, then ε" = 0. In this work, the lower the dielectric loss values means less loss. For example, the simple green cleaner has dielectric loss of 25 at 2.5 GHZ; on the other hand the WD 40 has dielectric loss around 1. As a result, the simple green cleaner has higher loss than WD 40.
3. The lumped LC used in Task 1 step 7 only works well at low frequency. At high frequency, the distributed components are prefered.</b>
