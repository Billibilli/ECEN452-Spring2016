Lab 11 – Free Space Measurement with GRL Calibration<br>

<b><br>Apply the report template to discuss the theory, setup, procedure, and sources of error for the Gated Line Reflect (GRL) calibration. In the results/discussion section, include the following plots:<br>



S11_TD_wReflect_preGRLcal.csv – This is a plot of the time domain S11 data with the reflect in place. Remember you can see the reflecting sheet as a local maximum at approximately 3.66ns.<br>

S21_Thru_postGRL.csv – This is a plot of the frequency domain S21 data with an empty test fixture. Comment on what the measurement should look like given that the system is calibrated.<br>

Air.csv, Cardboard.csv,Plexiglass.csv – Only plot the ε’ data for each material. You can plot the three data sets on the same graph.

What does it mean to transform into the time domain?<br>

How do you interpret the S11 data in time domain?<br>
Ans:<br>


How does looking at the time domain help with the calibration?<br>
Ans:<br>


What are we looking for when we put the reflect in before performing the calibration?<br>
Ans:<br>


How do the three materials measured compare to expectations?<br>
Ans:<br>


How could we improve the calibration process to get more accurate results?<br>
Ans:<br>










Conclusion:<br>

1. Dielectric constant of all the experimental material will change the values at different frequency. We observe the dielectric constant will decrease as the frequency goes higher.<br>
2. Dielectric loss ε" = σ/ω, for a lossless medium with σ =0, then ε" = 0. In this work, the lower the dielectric loss values means less loss. For example, the simple green cleaner has dielectric loss of 25 at 2.5 GHZ; on the other hand the WD 40 has dielectric loss less than 1. As a result, the simple green cleaner has higher loss than WD 40.<br>
