These calculations show the requested values of the valid frequency range, propagation velocity, and attenuation coefficient.

![TRL Calibration Kit Magnitude](ECEN452-Spring2016/Students/derekjanak/Lab3/Lab_3_Gain.png)
This chart shows the measured magnitude of the signal following TRL calibration over the range of design frequencies.  The magnitude
range shown is small and centers around zero, indicating an accurate calibration.
![TRL Calibration Kit Phase](ECEN452-Spring2016/Students/derekjanak/Lab3/Lab_3_Phase.png)
This chart shows the measured phase of the frequency sweep following TRL calibration.  Note that the measurement declines linearly.
