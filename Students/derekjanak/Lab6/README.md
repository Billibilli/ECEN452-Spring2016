Lab 6

Background:

In this week's lab, the students designed high frequency lowpass and bandstop filters.  The filters
were designed using distributed elements in a process that began with table lookup to determine the
necessary filter coefficients and culminated in transforming a ladder network to a series of open
circuit stubs through the application of Richard's Transformation and Kuroda's Identities.  The
lab culminated in the fabrication of the bandstop filter by means of a cut-and-solder technique 
utilizing copper tape on FR-4 substrate.

Application:

Filters are essential in many aspects of high frequency design, where it is necessary to remove noise
from signals which are transmitted or recieved.  A filter is used to process input signals from an
antenna and to focus output signals into a desired frequency band.

Design:

See images from Lab Notebook

Procedure:

The student cut and pasted strips of copper tape onto FR-4 substrate in order to create a distributed
element bandstop filter in microstrip according to the design calculations done in the prelab.  Separate
strips of tape were joined using solder, and the output was plotted using a network analyzer. 

Results:

See Plot images for data.

Conclusion:

In this lab, the student learned to design several basic filters for various high frequency signals.
The student then gained the added experience of fabricating their design and taking measurements on
the phase and magnitude of the frequency response.

Hindsight:

In hindsight, I could have used more time to calculate design parameters and to troubleshoot my design;
however, ultimately, this lab was a rewarding and engaging experience.

Reflection:

The most challenging portion of the lab was the completion of the necessary theoretical design work.
The lab proved exceedingly rewarding by serving as a proof-of-concept for my skills in microwave design.
