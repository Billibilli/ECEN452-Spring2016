## Background
Dielectric Probe Kit is used to measure the dielectric constant of materials. Usually it is good for measuring the dielectric constant of liquids or soft solids. The dielectric probe kit consists of an open ended section of coaxial line. The dielectric constant is measured by immersing or keeping the coaxial probe in contact with the material. The fields from the open circuit fringe into the material and they change as they come in contact with the material. The reflection data is used to characterize the dielectric constant. This method can be used for broadband measurements.

## Design
There was no design in this lab.

## Procedure
First, the coaxial probe is callibrated. The callibration involves measuring open circuit, short circuit (done using a shorting block) and DI water. DI water is used in callibration because it has the highest dielectric constant. Then the coaxial feed is placed inside material under test and the measurement is taken. We use a different software to take the measurement. After the measurement, the coaxial probe is cleaned and re-callibrated (as the callibration is very sensitive) for the next sample measurement.
