## Background

In this lab, we will measure the dielectric constants for various liquids using open-ended coaxial probe as shown in the next figure:

## Discussion

Resutls are close to what was expected. The reason for choosing DI water as a reference for calibration is because DI water has a stable dielectric constant over wide frequency range and e" appears at high frequency. To improve the calibration accuaracy we can make sure to reduce the following factors: Cable stability, air gaps and sample thickness. The coaxial probe method is broadband but it has a limited accuracy. From the behavior of e' and e" we can see that the following materials are watered down: WD-40, Glass cleaner and Silicon fluid.
