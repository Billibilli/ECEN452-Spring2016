## Background

In this lab we will design a Wilkinson power divider. The theory of the power divider is well established and the design is shown in figure 1. The design frequency was choosen to be 2.5 GHz.

fig.1 : Wilkinson Power Divider


## Design

An HFSS file was simulated for the power divider

Substrate : FR4
er = 4.1
tand = 0.01
h = 62 mil
fo = 2.5 GHz

## Procedure

The procedure is to calculate the dimensions of the structure at the specified frequency. Then optimizing the results to achieve the best performance as shown in the following figure.

## Discussion

The results of the HFSS model is shown in the next figure. Results are close to the simulation as expected.

## Conclusion

LPF and BSF design and simulations were performed successfully. Variations could be due to the effect of the SMA connectors in the fabricated design.

## Hindsight

## Reflection

It would be better to have a document for the lab
