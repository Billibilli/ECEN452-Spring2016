# Lab 5 Report
Mazin M Mustafa 

## Background

TRL calibration is a very useful calibration technique. TRL allows us to move the reference planes into the test fixture. This is important in order to cancel the effect of the transmission lines and coaxial connectors.

The second part is about PIN diode switch design. The purpose of this circuit is to design an RF switch

## Design
All of your calculations go here. Include relevant dimensions and/or diagrams. Comment on any modifications you had to make to your original design after simulation and include you rationale for making these modifications.

## Procedure
Provide a step-by-step decription of the activities you performed during the lab.

## Results and Discussion
Include measured/simulated Plots here. All plots are to be made in Python by modifying the csv plotter code. Explain how you can tell the device is working by examining the data (S-parameters). Comment on any differences between the measured and simulated results and sources of error.

To embed graphs or diagrams in your README.md file, commit and push the graphs to your LabX folder (I prefer to save them as .png files) and then get the URL link to the file on github. Then use: <br>
`![Plot_Name](https://link_to_image_on_github)` <br>

See the raw text of the tutorials for an example.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points in the design and results. Also mention unexpected challenges (if any) in the design and how you overcame them. 

## Hindsight
Comment on anything you know now, having completed the lab, that you wish you knew at the beginning of the lab.

## Reflection
Breifly describe the most challenging parts of the lab and the most rewarding parts of the lab.
