## Background

In this lab we will design a Rat Race and 90 degree Hybrid couplers. The theory of the two structures are well established and the design is the following figures. The design frequency was choosen to be 2.5 GHz.

fig.2 : Rat Race coupler

## Design

An HFSS file was simulated for the structures

Substrate : FR4
er = 4.1
tand = 0.01
h = 62 mil
fo = 2.5 GHz

## Procedure

The procedure is to calculate the dimensions of the structure at the specified frequency. Then optimizing the results to achieve the best performance as shown in the following figure.

## Discussion

The results of the HFSS model is shown in the next figure. Results are close to the simulation as expected.

## Conclusion

LPF and BSF design and simulations were performed successfully. Variations could be due to the effect of the SMA connectors in the fabricated design.

## Hindsight

## Reflection

It would be better to have a document for the lab
