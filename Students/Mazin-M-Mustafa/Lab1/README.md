## Background

In this lab we will become familiar with basic softwares and S parameters for series impedance.

## Design

There is no design

## Procedure

1- Python code was executed and the plot of the three datasets were generated as shown in figure 1:

fig.2 : Python output

HFSS & Z0lver files were simulated and the results are shown below:

## Discussion

The time domain transform measures the delay for receiving the reflected wave. The peak value of S11 indicates the MUT location. After applying a time window, this removes the effects of over reflections. The reflect in a calibration standard which helps in determining the location of MUT and also de-embed the free space. Results are close what was expected. 

## Conclusion

## Hindsight

## Reflection
