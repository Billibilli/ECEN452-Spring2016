# Lab 6 Report (Unfinished)
Jared Pocock

## Background
The goal of this lab was to build a band stop filter that would prevent transmission from 2.25 to 3.75 GHz. 

## Design
From the calculations in the pre-lab, the charateristic impedance of the thru line and center stub of the filter is 50 ohms, which when inputted to the online calculator gave a line width of 3 mm. From the pre-lab, we know that the other line widths for the stubs should be for 77 and 104 ohms should be 1.3 mm and .56 mm respectively. The lengths of all stubs were a quarter wavelength.

## Procedure
The first step in the lab is to lay the copper tape across the FR4 board to act as the transmission line. After that, the connectors on the ends of the transmission line are soldered onto the board. When that was finished, the strips of copper tape were cut out to the widths and length needed.

## Results and Discussion
Include measured/simulated Plots here. All plots are to be made in Python by modifying the csv plotter code. Explain how you can tell the device is working by examining the data (S-parameters). Comment on any differences between the measured and simulated results and sources of error.

To embed graphs or diagrams in your README.md file, commit and push the graphs to your LabX folder (I prefer to save them as .png files) and then get the URL link to the file on github. Then use: <br>

See the raw text of the tutorials for an example.

## Conclusion
The results were pretty close to what was expected, though it wasn't perfect. Total perfection would be difficult to achieve since the labs are mainly done with copper tape and it's extremely difficult to measure and cut copper tape to the exact size that is necessary. 
## Hindsight
If there was something that I wish I could change, it's that I would be better at soldering. I've never soldered before but I wish I learned before taking this class.

## Reflection
The hardest part of the lab is to just make sure that the calculations are correct, even if the widths are super tiny. The best part of the lab is checking and measuring the circuit and getting good data. Knowing that the equations we learn in class actually work in real life is actually a really gratifying feeling for me.
