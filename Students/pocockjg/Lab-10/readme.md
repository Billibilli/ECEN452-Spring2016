# Lab 10 Report
Jared Pocock (**Rename this file README.md and place it in the LabX folder in your student folder)

## Background
This lab uses a probe to measure the relative permitivity of various materials. Before measuring though, the probe has to be calibrated properly.

## Design
No designs were needed for the lab. There were only measurments.

## Procedure
The first step in the lab was to calibrate the probe. The probe first measured in air, then the probe measured the surface of a metal cube, and then finally measured while being submersed in DI water. With these calibration measurments, any noise or distortions are mostly eliminated from the system.

## Results and Discussion
Include measured/simulated Plots here. All plots are to be made in Python by modifying the csv plotter code. Explain how you can tell the device is working by examining the data (S-parameters). Comment on any differences between the measured and simulated results and sources of error.

To embed graphs or diagrams in your README.md file, commit and push the graphs to your LabX folder (I prefer to save them as .png files) and then get the URL link to the file on github. Then use: <br>
`![Plot_Name](https://link_to_image_on_github)` <br>
See the raw text of the tutorials for an example.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points in the design and results. Also mention unexpected challenges (if any) in the design and how you overcame them. 

## Hindsight
Comment on anything you know now, having completed the lab, that you wish you knew at the beginning of the lab.

## Reflection
Breifly describe the most challenging parts of the lab and the most rewarding parts of the lab.
