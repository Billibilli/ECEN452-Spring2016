# Lab 10 Report
Jared Pocock

## Background
This lab uses a probe to measure the relative permitivity of various materials. Before measuring though, the probe has to be calibrated properly.

## Design
No designs were needed for the lab. There were only measurments.

## Procedure
The first step in the lab was to calibrate the probe. The probe first measured in air, then the probe measured the surface of a metal cube, and then finally measured while being submersed in DI water. With these calibration measurments, any noise or distortions are mostly eliminated from the system.

## Results and Discussion


## Conclusion
Summarize the key points in the design and results. Also mention unexpected challenges (if any) in the design and how you overcame them. 

## Hindsight
Comment on anything you know now, having completed the lab, that you wish you knew at the beginning of the lab.

## Reflection
Breifly describe the most challenging parts of the lab and the most rewarding parts of the lab.
