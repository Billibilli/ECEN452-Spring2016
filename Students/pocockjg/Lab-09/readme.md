# Lab 9 Report
Jared Pocock

## Background
The device made in this lab is the patch antenna. To help with the design, David supplied us with the design equations needed. In addition to the patch antenna, a quarter wave transformer (QWT) was also made to impedance match the antenna.

## Design
Using the designs given to us at the beginning of the lab, we found the length and width needed to make the patch resonant for the required frequency. The calculations are given in the following photos. 

## Procedure
Provide a step-by-step decription of the activities you performed during the lab.

## Results and Discussion
Include measured/simulated Plots here. All plots are to be made in Python by modifying the csv plotter code. Explain how you can tell the device is working by examining the data (S-parameters). Comment on any differences between the measured and simulated results and sources of error.

To embed graphs or diagrams in your README.md file, commit and push the graphs to your LabX folder (I prefer to save them as .png files) and then get the URL link to the file on github. Then use: <br>
`![Plot_Name](https://link_to_image_on_github)` <br>
See the raw text of the tutorials for an example.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points in the design and results. Also mention unexpected challenges (if any) in the design and how you overcame them. 

## Hindsight
Comment on anything you know now, having completed the lab, that you wish you knew at the beginning of the lab.

## Reflection
Breifly describe the most challenging parts of the lab and the most rewarding parts of the lab.
