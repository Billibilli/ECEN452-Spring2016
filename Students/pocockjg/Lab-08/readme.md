# Lab 8 Report
Jared Pocock

## Background
For this lab, a rat race coupler and a hybrid coupler were simulated in HFSS. These devices are used to sum two in phase signals, split a single incoming signal or as part of a phase shifter.

## Design
The hybrid coupler should be designed to the following specifications

The rat race coupler should be designed to the following specification

The measurements had to be adjusted a little to make the parameters accurate at the design frequency. Both impedances had to be bigger than what was calculated.

## Procedure
Not much of a procedure. Just adjust the line widths to the correct number until the plots look accurate.

## Results and Discussion


## Conclusion
Summarize the key points in the design and results. Also mention unexpected challenges (if any) in the design and how you overcame them. 

## Hindsight
Comment on anything you know now, having completed the lab, that you wish you knew at the beginning of the lab.

## Reflection
Breifly describe the most challenging parts of the lab and the most rewarding parts of the lab.
