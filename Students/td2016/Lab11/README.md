# Lab 11 Report
Thomas Darden

## Background
For this lab, we shall be finding the dielectric constant of a solid material. A free space callibration was achieved by performing a GRL callibration. We then transmitted a signal through the signal and measured the response of the through and the reflected wave to find the permittivity. 

## Design
We did not design anything for this lab.

## Procedure
We first attach cables to the horn antennas, and callibrate them with a short, open, line, and thru calibration. We do this to remove any noise that may be tranmitted through the cables. The GRL calibration begins with placing a sheet of plexiglass between the horns followed by a piece of metal that to act as the reflecting surface. We then use a Fourier transform to manipulate the data to place the gates for the calibration. We also measured the air and cardboard.

## Conclusion


## Hindsight
N/A

## Reflections
From this lab, I was able to learn how we find the dielectric constants of solid as opposed to Lab 10, where we found the dieletric constants of liquids.
