#Lab 10 Report

Chung-Huan Huang

## Background
In this lab, dielectric constant are measured for several fluid materials.
<br>

## Design
No design for this lab, the whole process of this lab was done by David.
<br>

## Procedure 
The dielectric constant measurement probe has to be calibrated before measuring. The setup uses three different measured results for calibration, air, short and water. Once confirming that water dielectric constant is similiar to ideal value, then starting to measure different kinds of fluid dielectric constants. (Before starging each measurement, calibriation must be done.)

## Conclusion
The dielectric constants measured by the probe is very similiar to the ideal value (80.1 @ 20 degree Celcium). Even though there is a small difference, that may be caused by equipment error, human error, and temperature.
<br>

## Hindsight
Before measurement each time, the probe has to be calibrated and this technique is only good for fluid materials.
<br>

## Reflection
This is one of the ways to measure dielectric constant, especially is designed for fluid materials. It is very great to see the process of measuring.
