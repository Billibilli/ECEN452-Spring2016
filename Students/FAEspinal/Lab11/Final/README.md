# Lab 11 Report
Francisco Espinal

## Background
In this lab, we preformed free space measurements with GLR calibration. This calibration is similar to the TRL calibrations technique but is simpler. This is used for the measurements of permittivity or permeability of planar materials.  

## Design
We didnâ€™t have a design. No calculations were made. 

## Procedure
Everything was already set up and ready to go when we got into the lab. We just watch our TA preform all the necessary tasks. First he calibrated the network analyzer in order for us to get precise measurements using open and short circuits. Next he did the calibration for the horn antennas using air and a metal plate. Then he measured multiple materials as he explained everything that was happening.

## Conclusion
The GRL calibration worked perfectly. What does it mean to transform in to the time domain? How do you interpret the s11 data in time domain? How does looking at the time domain help with the calibration? What are we looking for when we put reflect in before performing the calibration? How do the three materials measured compare to expectations? How could we improve the calibration process to get more accurate results?

## Hindsight
NA

## Reflection
The most rewarding part of the lab was learning how this calibration was used in Diana project.
