# Lab 8 Report
We constructed a Hybrid Coupler and a Rate Race

## Background
Breifly explain what the device does and what it is used for. This section does not need to be a long paragraph and does not need to be very technical.

## Design
All of your calculations go here. Include relevant dimensions and/or diagrams. Comment on any modifications you had to make to your original design after simulation and include you rationale for making these modifications.

## Procedure
Provide a step-by-step decription of the activities you performed during the lab.
