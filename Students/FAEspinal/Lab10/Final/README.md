# Lab 10 Report
Francisco Espinal

## Background
In this lab we used a dielectric probe to determine the dielectric properties of multiple material. 

## Design
We didnâ€™t have a design. No calculations were made. 

## Procedure
Everything was already set up and ready to go when we got into the lab. We just watch our TA preform all the necessary tasks. First he calibrated the probe in order for us to get precise measurements using water, short, and open. Then he measured multiple materials as we listen to him explain everything he was doing.  

## Results and Discussion

## Conclusion
Why do we use DI water as a calibration standard? It gives the maximum difference between a shot and open circuit. What can we do to improve the calibration process? Can the dielectric probe be used for wideband of only narrowband measurements? What kind of generalizations can you make based on the type of liquid and their measured electrical properties? Which liquids were considered watered down and which one had the highest water content? 

## Hindsight
NA

## Reflection
The most rewarding part of this lab was getting to know about the background of the dielectric probe, and how complicated the math is to preform these measurements. It makes me appreciate the things we take advantage of.
