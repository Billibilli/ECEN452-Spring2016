# Lab 5 Report
Francisco A. Espinal

## Background
TRL calibration kit.... RF Pin diode series switch.... Breifly explain what the device does and what it is used for.

## Design
All of your calculations go here. Include relevant dimensions and/or diagrams. Comment on any modifications you had to make to your original design after simulation and include you rationale for making these modifications.

## Procedure
Provide a step-by-step decription of the activities you performed during the lab.

## Results and Discussion
Include measured/simulated Plots here. All plots are to be made in Python by modifying the csv plotter code. Explain how you can tell the device is working by examining the data (S-parameters). Comment on any differences between the measured and simulated results and sources of error.

See the raw text of the tutorials for an example.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points in the design and results. Also mention unexpected challenges (if any) in the design and how you overcame them. 

## Hindsight
Before starting the lab I wish i would've know....

## Reflection
The most challenging parts of the lab... The most rewarding parts of the lab...
