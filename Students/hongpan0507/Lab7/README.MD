## Background
1. Wilkinson power divider is capable of equally or unequally splitting input power. All ports are matched because of the resistor 
connecting the branch.
2. Phase shifter provides fixed or variable degree of phase shift.

## Design
### Equal Power Division
1. The microstrip width is determined from the substrate height, dielectric constant and characteristic impedance.
  + Input and output T-line characteristic impedance is 50ohms. 
  + The quater-wave T-line characteristic impedance is sqrt(2)*50ohms.
2. The value of the resistor is 100ohms  

### Phase shifter
1. The microstrip width is determined from the substrate height, dielectric constant and characteristic impedance.
  + All T-line characteristic impedance is 50ohms. 
2. The shortest T-line is used as a reference.
3. The second T-line is 1/4 wave length longer than the shortest T-line to provide 90deg phase shift.
4. The third T-line is 1/2 wave length longer than the shortest T-line to provide 180deg phase shift.

## Procedure
### Phase shifter
1. The shortest T-line is taped down and measured to provide reference phase.
2. The shortest T-line is cut, and additional 1/4 wavelength long T-line is added to the T-line. It's providing 90 degree of phase shift.
2. The 1/2 wavelength long T-line is replaced with a 1/2 wavelength long T-line to provide 180 degree of phase shift.
