# Lab 11 Report
Joshua Ruff

## Background
This lab introduced the gated calibration for free space systems. A two port calibration was used in lab to measure a plexiglass panel. A Fast Fourier Transform is used to move the signal into the time dowmain, where a time gate can be applied to filter out errors. 

## Procedure
The systematic errors described in the signal flow diagram can be removed using a gated calibration. First, the two ports are calibrated in air. An absorber sheet is used as a matched load, and finally a metal sheet is used as a short circuit.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points in the design and results. Also mention unexpected challenges (if any) in the design and how you overcame them. 

## Hindsight
Comment on anything you know now, having completed the lab, that you wish you knew at the beginning of the lab.

## Reflection
Breifly describe the most challenging parts of the lab and the most rewarding parts of the lab.
