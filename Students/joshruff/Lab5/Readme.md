## Background
The TRL kit is used to calibrate a network analyzer in situations where an Open Short Load Calibration would be Less accurate. 

The PIN Diode can be used in a switching circuit such as a Bias Tee to control the flow of RF Signals. 
## Design
TRL Kit: 
Parameters: 
Z_o 

PIN Diode: 

## Procedure
We calculated the major parameters for our TRL Kit and PIN Diode Switch, and simulated these devices with HFSS. We then Compared the simulated data to the measured results from David's prototypes.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points in the design and results. Also mention unexpected challenges (if any) in the design and how you overcame them. 

## Hindsight
Comment on anything you know now, having completed the lab, that you wish you knew at the beginning of the lab.

## Reflection
Breifly describe the most challenging parts of the lab and the most rewarding parts of the lab.
