# Lab 10 Report

## Background
The Dielectric probe measurement system uses the magnitude and phase of the S-Parameters of different materials to characterize their permittivity and permeability. The result is highly dependent on the topology of the measurement device used. This lab used a coaxial probe to take the dielectric measeurements. The probe has a sophisitcated error model, and a three stage calibration is used to remove error terms. The first two stages use a shorted and open circuit load, while the third stage uses DI Water. DI water has the advantages that its properties are extremely well known, and it's characteristic impedance is far enough away from the open and short circuit points on a smith chart to make it an acceptable load. 

## Procedure
The dielectric probe was calibrated for the measurement of a variety of materials, including Acetone, Isopropyl alcohol, DI water among others. To produce the most accurate measurements, the probe was recalibrated in between each measurement.
