# Lab 9 Report


## Background
The Microstrip Patch Antenna is a rectangular antenna characterized by it's length and width. The length of the antenna determines the operating frequency, while the width controls the impedance. Edge effects lead to a longer electrical length than physical length. To maximize the amount of power radiated by the patch, a stub is used to match the patch to the feeding circuitry. 

## Design
The patch was designed to target a 3 GHz operating frequency. 

## Procedure
Provide a step-by-step decription of the activities you performed during the lab.

## Results and Discussion
Include measured/simulated Plots here. All plots are to be made in Python by modifying the csv plotter code. Explain how you can tell the device is working by examining the data (S-parameters). Comment on any differences between the measured and simulated results and sources of error.

To embed graphs or diagrams in your README.md file, commit and push the graphs to your LabX folder (I prefer to save them as .png files) and then get the URL link to the file on github. Then use: <br>
`![Plot_Name](https://link_to_image_on_github)` <br>
See the raw text of the tutorials for an example.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points in the design and results. Also mention unexpected challenges (if any) in the design and how you overcame them. 

## Hindsight
Comment on anything you know now, having completed the lab, that you wish you knew at the beginning of the lab.

## Reflection
Breifly describe the most challenging parts of the lab and the most rewarding parts of the lab.
