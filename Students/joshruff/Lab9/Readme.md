# Lab 9 Report


## Background
The Microstrip Patch Antenna is a rectangular antenna characterized by it's length and width. The length of the antenna determines the operating frequency, while the width controls the impedance.

Edge effects lead to a longer electrical length than physical length, which is accounted for in the design. To maximize the amount of power radiated by the patch, a stub is used to match the patch to the feeding circuitry.

## Design
The patch was designed to target a 3 GHz operating frequency. The dimensions were calculated as follows:

The load was measured using the Network analyzer, and since the dimensions were slighlty off, the patch was matched to a resonant frequency of 3.11 GHz. 

## Procedure
The patch antenna was designed to the specifications in the lab manual, and constructed during lab using copper tape. The load impeadance of the patch was determined using the network analyzer, and a single stub was used to match the patch to the feedline. The device was then simulated in HFSS to compare with the measured results. 

## Results and Discussion

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points in the design and results. Also mention unexpected challenges (if any) in the design and how you overcame them.
