Double Stub Matching - Calculate the electrical lengths of the open-circuit stubs that complete the double stub matching network. Load impedance ZL = 100 - j50 ohms, Characteristic impedance Z0 = 50 ohms for all transmission lines.

Hybrid Coupler - Calculate the characteristic impedances of all transmission lines for a hybrid coupler operating in a circuit with a system impedance of 75 Ohms.

Wilkinson Power Divider - Calculate the value of the resistor R1 to complete the design of an unequal-split (2:1) Power Divider. Use the other
